<h2>Beef takes center stage with the fragrance of the paste sharing the spotlight</h2>
<p>This beef green curry is thicker than most versions. 
    It has no vegetables and although it is very green, it isn't very hot. This dish can be topped with fresh green chiles to bring up the heat. 
    A drizzle of fresh coconut creme on top adds to the creamy look of the meal.
